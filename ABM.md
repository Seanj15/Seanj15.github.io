## GEOG5990M - Programming for GIS: Core Skills 
### Assessment 1 - Agent-Based Model
This part of the online portfolio contains the final agent-based model produced for the ['*GEOG5990M - Programming for GIS: Core Skills*'](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/) course at the University of Leeds. The model has been coded in python, using an open source cross-platform IDE called '*Spyder*' (downloaded as part of the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)). 
### About the model
The aim of the project was to build up a simple [agent based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) (ABM) to simulate sheep (agents) grazing in an environment. At a basic level the ABM:
- builds an agent in space;
- gets them to interact with each other;
- reads in environmental data;
- gets agents to interact with the environment;
- randomizes the order of agent actions;
- displays the model as an animation;
- is contained within a Graphical User Interface (GUI);
- is initialised with data from the web.
